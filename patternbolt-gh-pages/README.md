PatternBolt
===========

Patternbolt is a fine selection of SVG pattern background, packed in a single or SCSS (or CSS ) file.<br>
Just put it in your project and add the right class to your elements. You can easily change pattern color and the pattern size changing the background css property, check the <a href="http://buseca.github.io/patternbolt/">demo page</a> to see how to do it.
The pattern is added in a "after" element and your original element still be inalterate and ready for manipulations.
As they are vectors they never pixelate, not even on retina screens ;) 
The pattern selection still be under development, to see the showcase, visit the <a href="http://buseca.github.io/patternbolt/">demo page</a>.
